# ModernFix

A Forge 1.16 mod that uses mixins to make the game slightly more performant (and hopefully less buggy too).

In the words of asiekierka, questionable "performance improvements" that are not in Forge for probably very good reasons.

Some fixes are based on prior work in various Forge PRs (check commit history and/or code comments). The config system
